Active Faults of Central America and the Caribbean
==================================================

This is a repository for a GIS dataset of active faults of Central America
and the Caribbean. It will eventually be added into the Global Earthquake
Model's Global Active Faults database and be used for seimsic hazard.

For now, it's just a set of fault traces with some metadata.

Enjoy.
